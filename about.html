				 <h2>Sweatcoin</h2>
				 
				  <br>
				  <br>
				 
				 <br>

				 <p>Would you like to earn while walking? Sweatcoin is an applications that counts every steps you do. This applications is great for walking to school or college, work, and walking to the park. This applications helps to motivates users to go outside, as outside steps is the only steps that can be converted to sweatcoin and not indoors. Sweatcoins have a features that makes user to walk and earn more coin by buying subscription plan. But most of all sweatcoin is free to use and can earn 5 sweatcoin per day. It is less than a subscription plan but in a years time of walking and meeting the goal users can claim their rewards. <br><br> Sweatcoin have two different subscrition plan, the trouble maker and the premium. Troublemaker subcrition have three different ways of paying, montly, 6 Months, and Yearly. Montly price: £0.99, 6 Months price: £5.49, Yearly price: £9.99. For the premium on the other hand, there is two type of paying, Monthly, and Yearly. Monthly price: £4.99, Yearly price: £24.99. The price of lifecoin subscription is calculated annually so it will be £2.91 a month and billed £34.99 a year. You can earn 5 sweatcoin a day from their free subscription, 50 sweatcoin a day from troublemaker, and unlimited sweatcoin earning from premium. Troublemaker, and Primium earning is double so if you have 1,000 steps, which is equivalent to 1 sweatcoin. 1,000 steps &divide; 1,000 = 1 sweatcoin x double = 2 sweatcoin.

				 <h2>Lifecoin</h2>
				 
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 
				 <p>Lifecoin is similar as sweatcoin. Users can claim rewards and the good things about this is users can download this lifecoin and sweatcoin at the same time and count your steps at the same day. This is similar as the other application aswell. Their is a subscription plan that enable user to earn more coin. However, In my prespective, I will prepare to stay this one as free, as the price is quiet expensive, and if you are financially stable it is great to support the developers and it also motivates you to go outside because you have something to lose, that keeps you going.<br><br>The price of lifecoin subscription is calculated annually so it will be £2.91 a month and billed £34.99 a year.

				 <h1>KNOW YOUR PERSONALITY</h1>
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 <p>Knowing your personality is very important to know what is suitable for you. People have different personality an introvert, extrovert, and ambivert. An introverted person limits people around them and enjoy being alone to regain energy. An extrovert like to be around people to regain their energy. An ambivert is both introvert and extrovert. You probably wondering what is the relation of connecting to nature and your personality. This is to know if you like to be in a crowd of people and connecting with nature or you are more of a like of, I need less people so I can relax in peace. There are parks that can be very crowded in summer and even in winter and there are parks also that is so big that you less likely to even see people walking around.
